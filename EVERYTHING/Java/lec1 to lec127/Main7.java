	    int a = 5;
	    int b = a++ + ++a + --a;
	    
	    a=5;

		System.out.println(a+"\n"+b+"\n"+c);
		
		// assignment operator -> "=" -> same as C
		
		// relational operator -> {==, <, <=, >, >=, != etc} -> same as C
		
	    // Logical operators -> { &&, ||, ! } -> same as C
	    
	    //ternary operator -> ? and : -> same as C i.e -> condition ? true: false;
	    
	    //more on operators in C or for java study geeksforgeeks
	    
	    //IN JAVA LOOPS AND SWITCH CASE ARE SAME AS IN C EXCEPT THIS ONE LOOP CALLED FOR EACH.
